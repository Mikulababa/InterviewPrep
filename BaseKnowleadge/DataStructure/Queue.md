# Queue
## Queue
* Queue is a linear data structure in which elements can be inserted only from one side of the list called rear, and the elements can be deleted only from the other side called the front. It follows FIFO (First In First Out).
* FIFO (First In First Out): The first element insert in the queue will be the first element which leaves teh queue.

## Some common applications of Queue data structure
+ Task Scheduling: Queues can be used to schedule tasks based on priority or the order in which they were received.
+ Resource Allocation: Queues can be used to manage and allocate resources, such as printers or CPU processing time.
+ Batch Processing: Queues can be used to handle batch processing jobs, such as data analysis or image rendering.
+ Message Buffering: Queues can be used to buffer messages in communication systems, such as message queues in messaging systems or buffers in computer networks.
+ Event Handling: Queues can be used to handle events in event-driven systems, such as GUI applications or simulation systems.
+ Traffic Management: Queues can be used to manage traffic flow in transportation systems, such as airport control systems or road networks.
+ Operating systems: Operating systems often use queues to manage processes and resources. For example, a process scheduler might use a queue to manage the order in which processes are executed.
+ Network protocols: Network protocols like TCP and UDP use queues to manage packets that are transmitted over the network. Queues can help to ensure that packets are delivered in the correct order and at the appropriate rate.
+ Printer queues :In printing systems, queues are used to manage the order in which print jobs are processed. Jobs are added to the queue as they are submitted, and the printer processes them in the order they were received.
+ Web servers: Web servers use queues to manage incoming requests from clients. Requests are added to the queue as they are received, and they are processed by the server in the order they were received.
+ Breadth-first search algorithm: The breadth-first search algorithm uses a queue to explore nodes in a graph level-by-level. The algorithm starts at a given node, adds its neighbors to the queue, and then processes each neighbor in turn.

### Message Queue
A message queue is a form of inter-process communication (IPC) that allows different software components or processes to communicate with each other by sending and receiving messages. It is a mechanism used for asynchronous communication, where the sender and receiver of messages don't need to be actively engaged in the communication at the same time.

Here are some key characteristics and components of a message queue:

1. **Message**: A message is a packet of data that contains information that one process wants to communicate to another. Messages can vary in content and format depending on the specific communication requirements.

2. **Queue**: The messages are typically stored in a queue data structure, which is a first-in, first-out (FIFO) data structure. This means that the messages are processed in the order they are received, like people waiting in a line.

3. **Producer**: A producer is a process or component that generates and sends messages to the queue. It places messages into the queue for other processes to consume.

4. **Consumer**: A consumer is a process or component that retrieves and processes messages from the queue. It takes messages from the queue and performs some action based on the contents of the message.

5. **Message Broker**: In some message queue systems, there is a message broker or message server that manages the queue. It ensures that messages are delivered to the appropriate consumers and can provide additional features like message routing, filtering, and persistence.

6. **Asynchronous**: Message queues enable asynchronous communication, meaning that the producer and consumer processes don't need to be actively waiting for each other. This decouples the sender and receiver, allowing them to work independently and at their own pace.

7. **Reliability**: Many message queue systems provide mechanisms for ensuring message delivery, even in the presence of failures. This can include features like message acknowledgment, retries, and message persistence.

Message queues are commonly used in various computing scenarios, such as distributed systems, microservices architectures, and applications that require loose coupling between components. They help improve scalability, fault tolerance, and overall system reliability by decoupling components and allowing them to work independently. Popular message queue systems include RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka, Apache ActiveMQ, and AWS SQS (Simple Queue Service), among others.
